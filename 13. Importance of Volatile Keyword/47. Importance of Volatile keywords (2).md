In Embedded Application, sometime the software needs the real-time data from sensor.

Tell the compiler this address is volatile.

## Keyword: `Volatile`

```c
#include <stdint.h>

#define SRAM_ADDRESS1 0x20000004U

int main(void)
{
    uint32_t value = 0;
    uint32_t volatile *p = (uint32_t*) SRAM_ADDRESS1;
    
    while(1)
    {
        value = *p;
        if(value) break;
    }
    
    while(1);
    
    return 0;
}
```

The `volatile` keyword forces the compiler to read the content of the address again and again.
