# 155.1 How Arduino Slave Mode Work



This Code is burnt on the Arduino Microcontroller.

```c
// Check if SPI communication is happening
if (digitalRead(SS) == LOW) {
    // If SS is LOW, it means the STM32 has selected this Arduino as the slave
    
    // Receive data from the STM32
    byte receivedData = SPI.transfer(0);  // 0 is a dummy value, you can change it based on your requirements
    
    // Process received data or perform actions based on the communication
    
    // Send data back to the STM32 (optional)
    // SPI.transfer(dataToSend);
    
    // Release the slave (deactivate SS)
    digitalWrite(SS, HIGH);
}
```

In the context of code, the state of the SS pin is implicitly checked by the condition `if (digitalRead(SS) == LOW)`. If the SS pin is LOW, it executes the block of code inside the conditional statement, indicating that the Arduino is selected by the STM32 master for SPI communication. If the SS pin is HIGH, it skips this block, meaning the Arduino is not selected as slave, and the SPI communication is not intended for it.



## Here's a breakdown of how the Arduino responds:

1. **SS (Slave Select) Pin on Arduino (Pin 10):**
   - The SS pin is configured as an input in the code (`pinMode(SS, INPUT);`). This is because, in SPI slave mode, the slave device listens for communication when its SS pin is pulled low. In the Code,  this signal is sent by STM32 NSS port.
2. **Checking SS State in the Loop:**
   - The code continuously checks the state of the SS pin in the `loop()` function with `if (digitalRead(SS) == LOW)`.
   - If the SS pin is pulled low (active), it indicates that the STM32 master has selected the Arduino as the target for SPI communication.
3. **SPI Communication Handling:**
   - If the SS pin is detected as low, the code inside the conditional block is executed.
   - It receives data from the master using `byte receivedData = SPI.transfer(0);`. The `SPI.transfer(0)` sends a dummy byte (0) to initiate communication and simultaneously receives the actual data from the master.
   - The received data can then be processed, and the Arduino can optionally send data back to the master.
4. **Releasing the Slave:**
   - After handling the communication, the slave releases itself by setting the SS pin high with `digitalWrite(SS, HIGH);`. This signifies that the Arduino is no longer selected, allowing other SPI devices to be selected by the master.
