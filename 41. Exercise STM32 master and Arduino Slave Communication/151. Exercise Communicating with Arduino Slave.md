# 151. Exercise: Communicating with Arduino Slave



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 class lecture. In the previous session, we explored the Send Data API. In today's exercise, we will delve into real SPI communication using an Arduino Uno as the SPI Slave and an STM32 board as the SPI Master.

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to enable the STM32 Master to send strings of data to the Arduino Slave when a button on the Master is pressed. The received data on the Arduino will be displayed on the Serial Port Terminal using the Arduino software.

## Configuration Settings

Here are the configuration settings we will use for this exercise:

- **SPI Mode:** Full duplex
- **STM32 Role:** SPI Master
- **Arduino Role:** SPI Slave
- **Data Frame Format:** DFF = 0
- **Slave Select Management (SSM):** Hardware (SSM = 0)
- **Serial Clock Speed:** SCLK = 2MHz
- **Frequent Clock:**  FCLK = 16MHz

## Important Note

In this exercise, the Master will not receive any data from the Slave. The Master will only transmit characters to the Slave, which will be displayed on the Arduino Serial Monitor.

## Connection Setup

### Components Required

- Arduino board (Uno or similar)
- STM32 Discovery board
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Logic level converter (to address voltage level incompatibility)

### Connection Steps

1. **Ground Connection:**

   - Connect the ground of the STM32 Discovery board to the ground of the Arduino.
   - Connect the ground pin of the logic converter to the ground point on the breadboard.

2. **Voltage Level Conversion:**

   - Connect the low-voltage terminal of the logic converter to the 3V rail on the breadboard.
   - Connect the high-voltage terminal of the logic converter to the 5V rail on the breadboard.
   - Supply 5V from the STM32 Discovery board to the 5V rail.
   - Supply 3V from the STM32 Discovery board to the 3V rail.

3. **SPI Pin Connections:**

   - Connect MOSI (PB15) of the STM32 to LV1, and HV1 to the MOSI pin (pin 11) of the Arduino.
   - Connect the Clock to LV2, and HV2 to pin 13 (SCK) of the Arduino.
   - MISO (PB14) is not used in this exercise.
   - Connect NSS (PB12) to LV3, and HV3 to pin 10 (CS/SS) of the Arduino.

4. **Logic Level Converter Usage:**

   - Use a bidirectional 4-channel logic level converter.
   - Ensure the LV signals (3V) connect to the low-voltage side, and HV signals (5V) connect to the high-voltage side.

**Note:** If logic level converter is unavailable, direct connections are possible but may risk data corruption. Care should be taken to avoid applying 5V signals to unpowered STM32 pins.

## Logic Analyzer (Optional)

- A logic analyzer can be used to capture data communication between the Master and Slave.
- Connect channels: Channel 0 (Clock), Channel 1 (MOSI), Channel 2 (MISO - not used), Channel 3 (NSS).
- Ground point of the logic analyzer should be connected to the common ground on the breadboard.

## Arduino Sketch

1. **Power the Arduino board.**
2. Download the SPI Slave sketch:
   - Use the provided `001SPISlaveRxString.ino` from the repository.
   - Open it with Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino board.

## Conclusion

With the hardware setup and Arduino sketch in place, the STM32 Master and Arduino Slave are configured for SPI communication. The next lecture will cover the development of the STM32 code (`007spi_txonly_arduino.c`). Stay tuned for the coding session in the upcoming class.
