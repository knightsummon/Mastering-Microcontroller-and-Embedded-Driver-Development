#  Document: Closing SPI Communication in STM32



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 class! In this session, we'll delve into the process of closing SPI communication. It's crucial to ensure that the SPI peripheral is not busy before attempting to conclude communication. We'll explore the busy flag in the status register, named BSY, and use it to determine whether the SPI is actively engaged in communication.

## Busy Flag in the Status Register

The **busy flag (BSY)** is located in the **status register (SR)**. If BSY is 0, it indicates that the SPI is not busy, implying that its data registers and shift register are at rest. Conversely, if BSY is equal to 1, the SPI is currently occupied with communication. The hardware automatically sets and clears this flag. Prior to closing the SPI communication, it is essential to check the BSY flag; only when it is 0 should the communication be terminated.

## Implementation Steps

To confirm that the SPI is not busy, the `SPI_GetFlagStatus()` API can be employed. Specifically, the `SPI flag busy` for SPI2 is utilized. By using a while loop, we continuously check the status of the busy flag. The loop breaks only when the function returns 0, signifying that the SPI is no longer busy, allowing for the safe conclusion of communication.

```c
//main() Funcion.
//lets confirm SPI is not busy
		while( SPI_GetFlagStatus(SPI2,SPI_BUSY_FLAG) );
```

This approach ensures that SPI communication is terminated only when it is safe to do so.

## Application to Previous Code

This methodology is crucial and was inadvertently omitted in a previous exercise. It has now been corrected to ensure that SPI communication is not abruptly terminated.

## Additional Consideration

In the provided code snippet, there is an additional modification suggested. The slave device might not be aware of the number of data bytes being sent. To address this, the length information is transmitted to the slave first. The slave's firmware can then utilize this information to fetch the appropriate number of data bytes.

```c
//first send length information
		uint8_t dataLen = strlen(user_data);
		SPI_SendData(SPI2,&dataLen,1);
```

This modification ensures that the slave device is informed about the length of the data being transmitted before fetching the actual data bytes.

## Conclusion

By following these steps and considerations, the SPI communication in STM32 can be closed safely, preventing any potential issues associated with prematurely terminating communication while the SPI is still busy. The provided code snippets offer practical implementation examples for your reference.
