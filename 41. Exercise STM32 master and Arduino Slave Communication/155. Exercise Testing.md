# 155. Exercise: Testing



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 class lecture. In today's session, we will be testing an application that involves SPI communication between a master and a slave. Let's go through the steps of testing and analyzing the results.

## SPI Slave Initialization

1. Download the sketch into the Arduino board.
2. Compile and download the sketch.
3. The board is now behaving as an SPI slave.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to observe the slave initialization message.
5. The slave is waiting for the SS (Slave Select) line to go low, controlled by the master.

## SPI Master Initialization

1. Move to the master side and compile the master code.
2. Download the master code.
3. Press the user button on the STM board to initiate communication.
4. Verify that the master is sending data using a logic analyzer.

## Logic Analyzer Setup

1. Disconnect any existing logic analyzer connections.
2. Connect the logic analyzer.
3. Set the sample rate and capture the data.
4. Observe the trace to ensure the master is transmitting data.

## Protocol Analysis

1. Use the Analyzer tool to decode the SPI protocol.
2. Configure channels: Channel 0 for clock, Channel 1 for MOSI, Channel 3 for enable.
3. Verify settings: MSB first, 8 bits, CPOL=0, CPHA=0, Enable line is active low.
4. Save settings.
5. Observe the decoded data, including the length (11) and the transmitted message ('hello world').

## Application Retesting

1. Reflash the master code.
2. Open the Serial Monitor and press the user button on the STM board.
3. Verify successful data reception.

## Extended Data Transmission

1. Replace 'hello world' with a longer string in the master code.
2. Compile and download the code.
3. Ensure the string length is within 255 characters due to using a single byte for length.
4. Test the application by tapping the user button.
5. Observe the trace for successful transmission of the longer string.

## Important Notes

1. Discuss the SPI peripheral enabling and disabling process.

- Enable SPI (SPE = 1) pulls NSS low, activating the slave.
- Disable SPI (SPE = 0) automatically pulls NSS high.

1. Emphasize waiting until SPI becomes free before disabling the peripheral.

## Debugging Tips

1. If issues arise, wait for the SPI to become free before disabling.
2. Use a logic analyzer to capture master data if the slave is not receiving data efficiently.

## Conclusion

1. Recap the changes made to the application.
2. Encourage students to reproduce the exercise and report any issues.
3. Highlight the efficiency of using a logic analyzer for debugging.
4. Conclude the lecture and look forward to the next session.
