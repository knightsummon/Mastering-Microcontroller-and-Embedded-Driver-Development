# 165. SPI Receive Data with Interrupt Implementation



## Introduction

Welcome back to the lecture! In this session, we will be implementing the reception of data using interrupts in the STM32 microcontroller. This process is similar to what you have previously done for the SPI API, with only minor changes required.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Copy and Paste

Let's start by copying the relevant code and making necessary adjustments.

```c
// Copy the body of SPI_SendDataIT, paste into SPI_ReceiveDataIT

uint8_t SPI_ReceiveDataIT(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle, uint8_t *pRxBuffer, uint32_t Len)
{
	uint8_t state = pSPIHandle->TxState;

	if(state != SPI_BUSY_IN_TX)
	{
		//1 . Save the Tx buffer address and Len information in some global variables
		pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer = pTxBuffer;
		pSPIHandle->TxLen = Len;
		//2.  Mark the SPI state as busy in transmission so that
		//    no other code can take over same SPI peripheral until transmission is over
		pSPIHandle->TxState = SPI_BUSY_IN_TX;

		//3. Enable the TXEIE control bit to get interrupt whenever TXE flag is set in SR
		pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 |= ( 1 << SPI_CR2_TXEIE );

	}


	return state;
}
```

### Step 2: Correcting Mistakes

It seems there was a mistake in the code referring to `TxState` instead of `RxState`. Correct this error by replacing instances of `TxState` with `RxState`.

```c
// Corrected code
uint8_t state = pSPIHandle->RxState;
```

### Step 3: Updating Interrupt Enable

Change the interrupt enable flag from `TXEIE` to `RXNEIE` as we are now focusing on receiving data.

```c
//3. Enable the RXNEIE control bit to get interrupt whenever RXNEIE flag is set in SR
pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 |= ( 1 << SPI_CR2_RXNEIE );
```

### Step 4: Variable Updates

Update the relevant variables to reflect the change from transmission to reception.

```c
//1 . Save the Rx buffer address and Len information in some global variables
pSPIHandle->pRxBuffer = pRxBuffer;
pSPIHandle->RxLen = Len;
```

**Finally**

```c
uint8_t SPI_ReceiveDataIT(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle, uint8_t *pRxBuffer, uint32_t Len)
{
	uint8_t state = pSPIHandle->RxState;

	if(state != SPI_BUSY_IN_RX)
	{
		//1 . Save the Rx buffer address and Len information in some global variables
		pSPIHandle->pRxBuffer = pRxBuffer;
		pSPIHandle->RxLen = Len;
		//2.  Mark the SPI state as busy in reception so that
		//    no other code can take over same SPI peripheral until reception is over
		pSPIHandle->RxState = SPI_BUSY_IN_RX;

		//3. Enable the RXNEIE control bit to get interrupt whenever RXNEIE flag is set in SR
		pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 |= ( 1 << SPI_CR2_RXNEIE );

	}


	return state;

}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! With these adjustments, you have successfully implemented SPI receive data with interrupts. Now we get the `state` of the SPI, we need ISR to provide the Interrupt Service according to the `state`. In the upcoming lectures, we will delve into SPI Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) handling and its implementation. Stay tuned, and I'll see you in the next lecture!
