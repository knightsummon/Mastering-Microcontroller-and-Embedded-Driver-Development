# 77. Writing Base Address C Macros for MCU's Embedded Memories:(1)



Find the base addresses of the FLASH and SRAM 

In STM32 microcontrollers, both Flash memory and SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) play crucial roles in the operation and functionality of the device.

1. **Flash Memory**:

   Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory used for storing program code and data. In STM32 microcontrollers, the Flash memory typically serves several important roles:

      

   - **Program Memory**: The Flash memory in STM32F4 microcontrollers is where the firmware or program code is stored. During the development process, the compiled code is written to the Flash memory, and when the microcontroller is powered on or reset, it executes the code stored in Flash memory. This program memory is non-volatile, meaning it retains its contents even when the power is removed.
   - **Firmware Updates**: Flash memory allows for firmware updates in the field. Manufacturers can release updates or patches for their devices, and users can flash the updated firmware onto the STM32F4 microcontroller to add new features, fix bugs, or improve performance without requiring a physical replacement of the chip.
   - **Data Storage**: Flash memory can also be used for storing non-volatile data such as configuration parameters, calibration data, user settings, or logged data. This data persists across power cycles and resets, making Flash memory a convenient storage solution for applications that require data persistence.
   - **Bootloader**: Some STM32F4 microcontrollers include a built-in bootloader stored in Flash memory. The bootloader is a small program responsible for initiating the system startup process, loading the main application from external sources (such as USB or serial interface), and updating the firmware if necessary. The bootloader is typically located at a specific address in Flash memory and is executed first upon device startup.

2. **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**:

   SRAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its data when power is removed. In STM32 microcontrollers, SRAM serves the following roles:

   - **Data Storage**: SRAM is used for storing data that is needed for the temporary operation of the microcontroller. This includes variables, stack memory, and other runtime data used by the program.
   - **CPU Registers**: Some STM32 devices may have CPU registers or core-coupled memory (CCM) that act like SRAM. These high-speed memory regions are used for storing critical data, and they are faster to access than the main SRAM.
   - **Stack Memory**: The stack, which is used for function calls, is often placed in SRAM. When functions are called and local variables are created, they are typically stored in the SRAM.
   - **Peripheral Buffers**: SRAM can be used for storing data buffers used by various peripherals like UART, SPI, and I2C.
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: If your application requires dynamic memory allocation, you might use SRAM for heap memory. Libraries like the C Standard Library's malloc and free functions allocate and deallocate dynamic memory from the SRAM.
