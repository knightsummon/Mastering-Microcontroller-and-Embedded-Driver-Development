# 77. Writing Base Address C Macros for MCU's Embedded Memories:(1)



Find the base addresses of the FLASH and SRAM 

In STM32 microcontrollers, both Flash memory and SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) play crucial roles in the operation and functionality of the device.

1. **Flash Memory**:

   Flash memory is a type of non-volatile memory used for storing program code and data. In STM32 microcontrollers, the Flash memory typically serves several important roles:

   - 

2. **SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)**:

   SRAM is volatile memory, meaning that it loses its data when power is removed. In STM32 microcontrollers, SRAM serves the following roles:

   - **Data Storage**: SRAM is used for storing data that is needed for the temporary operation of the microcontroller. This includes variables, stack memory, and other runtime data used by the program.
   - **CPU Registers**: Some STM32 devices may have CPU registers or core-coupled memory (CCM) that act like SRAM. These high-speed memory regions are used for storing critical data, and they are faster to access than the main SRAM.
   - **Stack Memory**: The stack, which is used for function calls, is often placed in SRAM. When functions are called and local variables are created, they are typically stored in the SRAM.
   - **Peripheral Buffers**: SRAM can be used for storing data buffers used by various peripherals like UART, SPI, and I2C.
   - **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: If your application requires dynamic memory allocation, you might use SRAM for heap memory. Libraries like the C Standard Library's malloc and free functions allocate and deallocate dynamic memory from the SRAM.
