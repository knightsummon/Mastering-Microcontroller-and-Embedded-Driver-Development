The function `GPIO_ToggleOutputPin` is designed to toggle the state of a specific output pin in a microcontroller's or embedded system's GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) port. It does this using a bitwise XOR operation to flip the state of the selected pin.

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. `pGPIOx` is a pointer to a structure (`GPIO_RegDef_t`) that represents a specific GPIO peripheral or port. This pointer identifies the GPIO port you want to manipulate.
2. `PinNumber` is an 8-bit integer that specifies the pin number you want to toggle within the selected GPIO port.

Inside the function:

- `1 << PinNumber` shifts the binary digit `1` to the left by `PinNumber` positions. This effectively sets a specific bit at the position `PinNumber` to 1, while all other bits remain 0.
- `pGPIOx->ODR` is used to access the Output Data Register (`ODR`) of the GPIO port pointed to by `pGPIOx`. The `ODR` holds the state of all the output pins in the port.
- The expression `pGPIOx->ODR ^= (1 << PinNumber)` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the value stored in `pGPIOx->ODR` (the current state of all pins in the port) and the result of the shift operation. This XOR operation flips the state of the selected pin without affecting the other pins.

In effect, this function toggles (changes from high to low or low to high) the state of the specified pin without affecting the other pins on the same GPIO port. It is a common operation when you want to control digital outputs, such as turning an LED on and off, or switching other digital devices.

## Conclusion:

`XOR/^=` is specific to toggle the specified Pinx value conveniently.l
