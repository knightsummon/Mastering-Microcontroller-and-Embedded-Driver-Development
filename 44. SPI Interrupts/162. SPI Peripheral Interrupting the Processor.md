# 162. SPI Peripheral Interrupting the Processor



## Introduction

Welcome back to the lecture series. In this session, we will delve into the topic of SPI interrupts. Interrupts play a crucial role in SPI communication, as various events during the communication process can trigger interrupts and potentially interrupt the processor.

## Events Leading to Interrupts

1. **Transmit Buffer Ready (TXE)**

   - Indicates that the Tx buffer is empty.
   - When TXE flag is set in the status register, it can be configured to generate an interrupt.
   - Default: Interrupts from SPI peripheral are disabled.

2. **Receive Buffer Not Empty (RXNE)**

   - Occurs when the Rx buffer is full.
   - RXNE flag set in the status register has the potential to interrupt the processor.

3. **Master Mode Fault**

   - Potential error in multi-master configuration.
   - Single master configuration should prevent this error by managing the NSS pin.
   - Not discussed further in this course, assuming single master mode usage.

4. **Overrun Error**

   - Error indicating data overrun.
   - Overrun error flag set in the status register can generate an interrupt.

## Enabling Interrupts

- Interrupts can be enabled and disabled separately.
- By default, interrupts from the SPI peripheral are disabled.
- Control bits in the control register (e.g., TXEIE for Tx buffer empty, ERRIE for SPI error) determine whether interrupts are enabled.

## IRQ Numbers and NVIC

- SPI interrupts are directly connected to the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC).
- Each SPI peripheral has its own interrupt line going from peripheral to NVIC.
- Exercise: Define SPI IRQ numbers in the MCU specific header file.

## Exercise for Students

1. **Define SPI IRQ Numbers**
   - Complete the SPI IRQ number definition macros in the MCU specific header file based on the reference manual's vector table information.
2. **Implement SPI IRQ Configuration APIs**
   - Copy the IRQ configuration and ISR handling section from the GPIO driver.
   - Implement these APIs in the `spi_driver.c` file.
   - Reuse the code from the GPIO driver with necessary modifications.

## Next Lecture Preview

In the upcoming lecture, we will implement the SPI send data API with interrupt mode. Stay tuned for the practical application of SPI interrupts in the next session.
