# 84. Structuring Peripheral Registers

**Look into the manual `8 General-Purpose I/Os (GPIO)/8.4 GPIO register`**

## C Structure for Registers of GPIO Peripheral

```c
//Helps Programmers for easy access to various registers of the peripherals
pGPIOA->MODER =25;//Storing value 25 in to MODER register
*(0x40020000+0x00) = 25; //This is how compiler does
pGPIOA->ODR = 44;  //Storing value 44 in to OD register
*(0x40020000+0x00) = 44; //This is how compiler does
```
