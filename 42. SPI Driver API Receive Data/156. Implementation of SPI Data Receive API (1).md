# 156. Implementation of SPI Data Receive API: (1)



## Introduction

Welcome back to the lecture series on STM32 SPI! In the previous videos, we successfully explored sending data through SPI. In this lecture, we'll delve into the process of receiving data. The methodology is quite similar to sending data, with a few modifications.



## Receiving Data Process

### 1. User Specifies Data Length

The user needs to specify the length of the data to be received. If the length is not zero, the microcontroller will wait until the receive (RX) buffer is non-empty.

### 2. Polling for RXNE Flag

- Wait until the RX buffer is full.
- The RXNE (Receive Buffer Not Empty) flag is an indicator that a data byte has been received.

### 3. Check Data Frame Format (DFF)

- Once the RXNE flag is set, check the Data Frame Format (DFF).
- If DFF is 0 (indicating an 8-bit data frame), read the data register for one byte of data.
  - Read the data register.
  - Store the received byte into the RX buffer.
  - Increment the RX buffer address.
  - Decrement the data length.
- If DFF is 1 (indicating a 16-bit data frame), read the data register for two bytes of data.
  - Read 2 bytes of data.
  - Store them into the RX buffer.
  - Increment the RX buffer address.
  - Decrement the data length twice.

### 4. Repeat Until Length Becomes 0

- Continue the process in a loop until the specified data length becomes zero.

### 5. Implementation

Implementing the receive data code is straightforward and similar to the send data code, with a few necessary adjustments.

## Conclusion

Receiving data via SPI involves waiting for the RX buffer to be non-empty, checking the DFF, and then reading and storing data bytes accordingly. It's a simple process, and you are encouraged to try implementing it at your desk. The actual code will be demonstrated in the next lecture.
