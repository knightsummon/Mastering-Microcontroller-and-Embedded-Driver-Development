# 134. SPI API Requirements and Configuration items



## Lecture Overview

Welcome back to the course! In this lecture, we will be delving into SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) driver development. Let's begin by understanding the necessary driver API requirements and exploring various user-configurable items. This lecture builds upon the previous development of `GPIO_driver.c` and `driver.h`. Now, our focus is on `spi_driver.c` and `driver.h`.

### Course Progress

1. Completed development of `GPIO_driver.c` and `driver.h`.
2. Transitioning to `spi_driver.c` and `driver.h`.
3. Introduction to the MCU-specific header file, necessitating an update with SPI details.

## API Requirements

To ensure the proper functioning of our SPI driver, we need to define certain mandatory API functions. These include:

- SPI Initialization API: To configure SPI registers based on user-provided configurable items.
- Peripheral Clock Control API: Similar to what we did for GPIO, enabling/disabling the peripheral clock.
- SPI TX and SPI RX APIs: Facilitating data transmission and reception to/from the external world.
- SPI Interrupt Configuration: Setting up SPI-specific IRQ number, initializing priority registers, NVIC registers, etc.
- SPI Interrupt Handling: Ensuring the proper handling of SPI interrupts.
- Other Management APIs: Additional functionalities such as enabling/disabling the SPI peripheral.

### Configurable Items

For user applications, several configurable items need to be addressed:

1. **SPI Device Mode:** Determine whether the device should operate as a master or slave.
2. **Communication Mode:** Full duplex, half duplex, or simplex.
3. **Data Frame Format (DFF):** Specify the size of data to be sent (8 bits or 16 bits).
4. **CPHA and CPOL Initialization:** Optional, as default values are zero, but users can customize them.
5. **Slave Select Management (SSM):** Choose between software and hardware slave management.
6. **SPI Speed:** Specify the required serial clock speed.

## SPI Configuration Structure

Create a `SPI_Config_t` structure to hold all configurable items, mirroring what was done for the GPIO driver. This structure includes variables for each discussed configurable item.

## SPI Handle Structure

Create a handle structure for SPI, with its first member being the base address of the SPI peripheral (`SPI_RegDef_t` type).

## Exercises

Before concluding this lecture, you are given two exercises:

1. Complete SPI register definition structure and other macros (peripheral base addresses, Device Definition, clock en, clock di, etc) in the MCU-specific header file.
2. Complete SPI configuration structure and SPI handle structure in the `spi_driver.h` file.
