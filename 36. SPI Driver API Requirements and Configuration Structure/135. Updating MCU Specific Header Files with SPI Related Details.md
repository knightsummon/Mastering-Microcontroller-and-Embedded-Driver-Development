# 135. Updating MCU Specific Header Files with SPI Related Details



## Device Specific Header File Modifications

### 1. Peripheral Base Addresses

- Start by adding the base addresses for the peripherals. In this particular microcontroller, there are 4 SPI peripherals, not just the 3 mentioned earlier.

### 2. SPI_RegDef_t Structure

- Create an `SPI_RegDef_t` structure to encapsulate the details of the SPI registers. Obtain these details by navigating to the SPI section, exploring the registers, and referring to the register map.

### 3. Peripheral Definitions

- Define the peripherals after the structure creation. Ensure that you include SPI4 if applicable.

```c
#define SPI1  				((SPI_RegDef_t*)SPI1_BASEADDR)
#define SPI2  				((SPI_RegDef_t*)SPI2_BASEADDR)
#define SPI3  				((SPI_RegDef_t*)SPI3_BASEADDR)
```



### 4. Clock Enable and Disable Macros

- Implement clock enable and disable macros specific to your microcontroller. These macros are crucial for managing the clock state of the SPI peripherals.

```c

/*
 * Clock Enable Macros for SPIx peripheralsbu
 */
#define SPI1_PCLK_EN() (RCC->APB2ENR |= (1 << 12))
#define SPI2_PCLK_EN() (RCC->APB1ENR |= (1 << 14))
#define SPI3_PCLK_EN() (RCC->APB1ENR |= (1 << 15))
#define SPI4_PCLK_EN() (RCC->APB2ENR |= (1 << 13))
```



### 5. IRQ Definitions

- Create IRQ definitions for handling SPI interrupts. However, these will be covered in detail in a future lecture when we delve into SPI interrupts. For now, focus on the aforementioned changes.

## `spi_driver.h` Modifications

### 1. Structure Definitions

- In the `spi_driver.h` file, make sure you have created the configuration structure and the handler structure. These structures are essential for configuring and managing the SPI module.
