# Lecture on SPI Interrupt Implementation

## Welcome back to the lecture!

In today's session, we will delve into the implementation of SPI commands and explore a debugging technique using semihosting. If you encounter any challenges with implementing certain commands, worry not! You can find the complete source code for this application in our repository.

### Debugging with Semihosting

To facilitate debugging and observe the slave's responses, especially if you lack a USB logic analyzer, we will be using semihosting provided by ARM. Remember, semihosting functions only when both the board and the IDE (Eclipse, in this case) are in debug mode.

#### Three Steps for Semihosting Implementation

1. **Linker Arguments:**
   - Download the provided file from the resources section.
   - Copy the linker arguments.
   - In Eclipse, right-click on your project, go to properties.
   - Under C/C++ Build, navigate to Settings -> Linker -> Miscellaneous.
   - Paste the linker arguments and click Apply.
2. **Debug Configuration:**
   - Build the project to generate the binary.
   - Right-click, go to Debug As -> Debug Configuration.
   - In the startup, select the binary debug, and in the run commands, paste the provided command.
   - Click Apply and Close.
3. **Application Code Modification:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code at the beginning of the `main.c` file.
   - Initialize monitor handles at the start of the `main` function.
   - Exclude `sysmem.c` from the build, clean the project, and rebuild.

Now, feel free to insert printf statements in your code for better insight. Make sure to follow the provided instructions for each command in your application.

### Troubleshooting and Solutions

During the debugging process, you might encounter issues, such as exceptions due to floating-point-related problems. If this happens, inform the compiler that your microcontroller lacks a floating-point unit, ensuring the use of software-based floating-point libraries.

1. Go to C/C++ Perspective.
2. Right-click, go to Properties -> MCU Settings.
3. Deselect the floating-point hardware option to enable software-based floating-point libraries.
4. Clean and rebuild the project.

### Testing the Application

After resolving any issues, initiate the debugging session. If you face unexpected exceptions, consider the floating-point-related solution discussed earlier.

Once your application is running, use the debugging mode to analyze responses from the slave. Commands like sensor read, LED status, and board ID should now execute without errors.

### Next Lecture: SPI Interrupts

In the upcoming lecture, we'll explore SPI interrupts to convert blocking calls into non-blocking ones. This will enhance the efficiency of SPI read, send data, and receive data operations. Dive into the code, reproduce the results, and join us in the next session to master SPI interrupts!
