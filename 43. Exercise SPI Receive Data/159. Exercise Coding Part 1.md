# 159. Exercise: Coding Part 1



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 class lecture. In this session, we will be implementing an exercise discussed in the previous lecture. The exercise involves utilizing SPI communication and integrating a button into the code. We will focus on configuring the MISO line and handling different command codes to control a LED using an Arduino board.

## Source File Creation

A new source file named `008spi_cmd_handling.c` has been created for this exercise. Most of the code from the previous exercise has been copied, and a button initialization has been added.

Reference: https://github.com/niekiran/MasteringMCU/blob/master/Resources/Source_code/Workspace/stm32f4xx_drivers/src/008spi_cmd_handling.c

## SPI Bus Configuration

Uncommented lines in the code configure all four lines of the SPI bus. Additionally, several macros representing command codes, LED control, sensor reading, and other commands have been included. The code for turning the LED on and off has been defined, along with Arduino analog pins and their corresponding codes. **A LED is connected to pin number 9 of the Arduino board.**

```c
//extern void initialise_monitor_handles();

//command codes
#define COMMAND_LED_CTRL      		0x50
#define COMMAND_SENSOR_READ      	0x51
#define COMMAND_LED_READ      		0x52
#define COMMAND_PRINT      			0x53
#define COMMAND_ID_READ      		0x54

#define LED_ON     1
#define LED_OFF    0

//arduino analog pins
#define ANALOG_PIN0 	0
#define ANALOG_PIN1 	1
#define ANALOG_PIN2 	2
#define ANALOG_PIN3 	3
#define ANALOG_PIN4 	4

//arduino led

#define LED_PIN  9
```



## Exercise Implementation

The implementation focuses on coding for the first two commands, and students are encouraged to code for the remaining commands.

## Main Code

In the `main` function, unnecessary lines have been removed, and the process of sending commands to the SPI peripheral is initiated when the button is pressed.

### Sending No.1 Command (CMD_LED_CTRL)

The code sends the command code `CMD_LED_CTRL` to the SPI peripheral. Upon receiving the command, the slave sends an acknowledgment (ACK) or not acknowledged (NACK) byte.

```c
//1. CMD_LED_CTRL  	<pin no(1)>     <value(1)>

		uint8_t commandcode = COMMAND_LED_CTRL;
		uint8_t ackbyte;
		uint8_t args[2];

		//send command
		SPI_SendData(SPI2,&commandcode,1);

		//do dummy read to clear off the RXNE
		SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&dummy_read,1);


		//Send some dummy bits (1 byte) fetch the response from the slave
		SPI_SendData(SPI2,&dummy_write,1);

		//read the ack byte received
		SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&ackbyte,1);

		if( SPI_VerifyResponse(ackbyte))
		{
			args[0] = LED_PIN;
			args[1] = LED_ON;

			//send arguments
			SPI_SendData(SPI2,args,2);
			// dummy read
			SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,args,2);
			printf("COMMAND_LED_CTRL Executed\n");
		}
		//end of COMMAND_LED_CTRL

```



### Verifying Response

A function named `SPI_VerifyResponse` is created to verify whether the received byte is an ACK or NACK.

```c

		//read the ack byte received
		SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&ackbyte,1);

		if( SPI_VerifyResponse(ackbyte))
		{
			args[0] = ANALOG_PIN0;

			//send arguments
			SPI_SendData(SPI2,args,1); //sending one byte of

			//do dummy read to clear off the Master RXNE Flag
			SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&dummy_read,1);

			//insert some delay so that slave can ready with the data
			delay();

			//Send some dummy bits (1 byte) fetch the response from the slave
			SPI_SendData(SPI2,&dummy_write,1);

			uint8_t analog_read;
			SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&analog_read,1);
			printf("COMMAND_SENSOR_READ %d\n",analog_read);
		}
```

#### Sending Arguments

If the response is an ACK, arguments (pin number and value) are sent to the slave.

#### Dummy Read

Before sending the next dummy byte, a dummy read is performed to clear the RXNE (Receive Buffer Not Empty) flag.

## Testing

The application is tested with only one command to ensure correct functionality. The logic analyzer is used to capture the trace, and the successful execution of the command is confirmed.

## Conclusion

The provided code is a simple and straightforward implementation of SPI communication to control a LED using different command codes. Further commands can be implemented by extending the code structure based on the discussed principles. Students are encouraged to experiment and expand on the provided exercise to enhance their understanding of STM32 development.
