#  STM32 Lecture: Implementing Sensor Read Command

## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 lecture. In this session, we'll be implementing the second command, "sensor read," which involves sending one of the analog pin numbers to the sensor.

## Procedure Overview

1. **Wait for Button Press:**
   - Begin by waiting for the button to be pressed. Copy the relevant code to achieve this.
2. **Disable SPI at the End:**
   - Since SPI is not disabled yet, disable it at the end of the process.
3. **Command Code Setup:**
   - Set up the command code for sensor read: `commandcode = COMMAND_SENSOR_READ`.
4. **Send Command:**
   - Transmit the command code to the slave.
5. **Repeat Necessary Operations:**
   - Repeat the operations to clear the RXNE, send dummy bytes, and acknowledge reception.
6. **Create a Common Function:**
   - Consider creating a common function to handle repetitive tasks.
7. **Implement the Sensor Read Command:**
   - Copy the required operations into the function. Use `args[0]` to specify the analog pin number (e.g., analog pin 0).
8. **Read Sensor Value:**
   - Read the response from the slave, as the command is SENSOR_READ. This involves a dummy read, dummy write, and receiving the actual sensor value.

## Summary of  8. Sensor Read Command

- **Command Code:** SENSOR_READ

- Send Command Steps:

  1. Send command code.
  2. Clear RXNE and send dummy bytes for acknowledgment.
  3. Send analog pin number as an argument.
  4. Perform dummy read and dummy write.
  5. Receive and store the sensor analog value.

  ```c
  		//2. CMD_SENOSR_READ   <analog pin number(1) >
  
  		//wait till button is pressed
  		while( ! GPIO_ReadFromInputPin(GPIOA,GPIO_PIN_NO_0) );
  
  		//to avoid button de-bouncing related issues 200ms of delay
  		delay();
  
  		commandcode = COMMAND_SENSOR_READ;
  
  		//send command
  		SPI_SendData(SPI2,&commandcode,1);
  
  		//do dummy read to clear off the RXNE
  		SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&dummy_read,1);
  
  
  		//Send some dummy byte to fetch the response from the slave
  		SPI_SendData(SPI2,&dummy_write,1);
  
  		//read the ack byte received
  		SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&ackbyte,1);
  
  		if( SPI_VerifyResponse(ackbyte))
  		{
  			args[0] = ANALOG_PIN0;
  
  			//send arguments
  			SPI_SendData(SPI2,args,1); //sending one byte of
  
  			//do dummy read to clear off the RXNE
  			SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&dummy_read,1);
  
  			//insert some delay so that slave can ready with the data
  			delay();
  
  			//Send some dummy bits (1 byte) fetch the response from the slave
  			SPI_SendData(SPI2,&dummy_write,1);
  
  			uint8_t analog_read;
  			SPI_ReceiveData(SPI2,&analog_read,1);
  			printf("COMMAND_SENSOR_READ %d\n",analog_read);
  		}
  ```

## Testing the Application

- Connect a jumper wire to different positions (e.g., ground, 5V, 3.3V) to simulate sensor readings.
- Compile and download the code.
- Use a logic analyzer to observe the results.
- Ensure proper delays to allow the slave to be ready with the data.

## Debugging Note

- Ensure a suitable delay is introduced after sending the command to allow the slave to complete ADC conversion before reading the sensor value.

## Updates and Corrections

- A small correction: Keep all relevant codes inside the if block that checks for ACK reception. This ensures that the implemented codes are executed only when the ACK is received.

## Conclusion

You've successfully implemented the SENSOR_READ command and tested its functionality. Feel free to explore and implement the remaining commands from the provided code repository. If you encounter any issues or need assistance, refer to the code repository and see you in the next lecture.
