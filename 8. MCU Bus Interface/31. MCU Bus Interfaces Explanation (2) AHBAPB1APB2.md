# 31. MCU Bus Interfaces Explanation (2): AHB/APB1/APB2



If the instructions are present in between the memory location `0x00000000` to `0x1FFFFFFC` then the processor will fetch the instructions using ICODE interface.

If the instructions are present outside of `0x00000000` to `0x1FFFFFFC` then processor fetches the instructions over system bus.

If the data is present in between memory location `0x00000000` to `0x1FFFFFFF`, then processor fetches the data over D-CODE bus Interface.

If the data is present outside `0x00000000` to `0x1FFFFFFF` memory locations then, the data will be fetched over the system bus.
