2. Processor can fetch instructions from SRAM over i-code bus interface?

   False.

3. System Bus can operate at the speed up to 180MHZ?

   True

4. SRAMs are connected to System Bus?

   True

5. APB1 bus can operate at the speed up to 180MHZ?

   False

6.  I have a peripheral whose datasheet says that, It's operating frequency of speed must be above 95MHZ, can I connect that peripheral via APB2 bus?

   False

7.  Processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from SRAM?

   False.

8.  Processor can fetch instructions as well as data simultaneously from FLASH?  

   True, ICode and DCode.  

9.  What is the Max. HCLK clock value of your MCU?

   180MHZ

10.  What is the MAX. P1CLK value of your MCU?

    45 MHZ (APB1)

11.  What is the MAX. P2CLK value of your MCU?

    90 MHZ (APB2)

12.  GPIOs and Processor communicate over AHB1 bus?

    True

13.  USB OTG and Processor communicate over AHB2 Bus?

    True

14.  USB OTG and GPIOs can communicate to Processor concurrently?

    False, The bus Matrix will serialize the access.

15.  Processor can talk to flash memory and SRAM simultaneously?

    True, they all have their own dedicated port. Flash can talk with I-Bus and D-Bus, S-Bus is go for SRAM.
