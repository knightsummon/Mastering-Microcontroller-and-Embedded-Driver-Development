# 127. SPI Functional Block Diagram Explanation



The functional block diagram of the STM32F407x microcontroller's SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) peripheral. 

1. **Block Diagram Overview:**

   - Access the functional block diagram in the reference manual, usually found in section 28.
   - Most ST microcontrollers share a similar block diagram principle.
   - Four pins are associated with each SPI peripheral: NSS (Slave Select), serial clock, MISO, and MOSI.
   - Shift register width is up to 16 bits for data communication.

2. **Components of the Block Diagram:**

   - **Shift Register:** Handles data transmission and reception.
   - **Baud Rate Generator:** Controls the clock pin if the peripheral is a master.
   - **Buffers:** Includes RX (receive) buffer and TX (transmit) buffer accessible via the APB bus.

3. **Data Transmission Path:**

   - Data loaded into the TX buffer by the firmware.
   - When the shift register is free, data moves from the TX buffer to the shift register.
   - Data is transmitted from the master to the external world over the MOSI line.

4. **Data Reception Path:**

   - Received data is stored in the shift register.
   - When a complete data frame is received, the data moves from the shift register to the RX buffer.
   - Interrupts signal when the TX buffer is empty (for loading data) and when the RX buffer is full (data reception).

5. **Register Sets:**

   - Control registers (e.g., Control Register 1, Control Register 2, Baud Rate Control Register) configure and control the SPI peripheral.
   - Baud rate generation bits in Control Register 1 control the serial clock frequency.
   - Control Register 1 allows selection of data frame format (8 or 16 bits).
   - Master control bit configures the peripheral as master or slave.
