# 126. SPI Bus Configuration Discussion: Full Duplex, Half Duplex and Simplex



the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus in different modes: full duplex, half duplex, and simplex.

1. **Full Duplex Communication:**

   - SPI is inherently full duplex, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception.
   - Master and slave shift registers are linked using separate MOSI and MISO pins.
   - Data is synchronously shifted on clock edges provided by the master.
   - Default configuration on microcontrollers.

2. **Half Duplex Communication:**

   - Uses a single line for data transmission, saving pins.
   - MOSI of master connected to MISO of slave with a resistor in between.
   - NSS (Slave Select) is optional if there's only one slave.
   - Requires reciprocal configuration of master and slave modes (transmitter/receiver).

3. **Simplex Communication:**

   - Divided into transmit-only and receive-only modes.
   - Example of simplex communication: master in transmit-only, slave in receive-only.
   - MOSI lines connected, MISO lines disconnected for one-way communication.
   - Unused input pins can be configured as GPIOs for other purposes.
