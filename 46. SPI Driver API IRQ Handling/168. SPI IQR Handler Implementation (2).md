# 168. SPI IQR Handler Implementation (2)



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 class lecture! In this session, we will focus on implementing helper functions for handling SPI communication on the STM32 microcontroller.

## Helper Function Prototypes

Let's start by defining the prototypes for these helper functions. It's important to note that these functions are considered private and should not be called directly by the user application. Therefore, we'll place the prototypes in the `stm32f407xx_spi_driver.c` file instead of the public `stm32f407xx_spi_driver.h file`.

```c
#include "stm32f407xx_spi_driver.h"

static void  spi_txe_interrupt_handle(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle);
static void  spi_rxne_interrupt_handle(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle);
static void  spi_ovr_err_interrupt_handle(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle);
```

The use of the `static` keyword makes these functions private, preventing direct calls from the user application.

## Implementation of Helper Functions

Now, let's proceed to implement these helper functions, starting with the `spi_handle_txe_interrupt` function (as a callback function for interrupt).

```c
static void spi_txe_interrupt_handle(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle)
{
    // Check the DFF bit in CR1 to determine data frame format (16-bit or 8-bit)
    if( (pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR1 & (1 << SPI_CR1_DFF)) )
    {
        // 16-bit DFF
        // Load the data into the data register (DR)
        pSPIHandle->pSPIx->DR = *((uint16_t*)pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer);
        pSPIHandle->TxLen -= 2;  // Decrease the length by 2 for 16-bit data
        (uint16_t*)pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer++;  // Move the buffer pointer to the next 16-bit data
    }
    else
    {
        // 8-bit DFF
        // Load the data into the data register (DR) (callback)
        pSPIHandle->pSPIx->DR = *pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer;
        pSPIHandle->TxLen--;  // Decrease the length by 1 for 8-bit data
        pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer++;  // Move the buffer pointer to the next 8-bit data
    }

    // Check if TxLen is zero, indicating the end of transmission
    if (!pSPIHandle->TxLen)
    {
        // TxLen is zero, so close the SPI transmission and inform the application that TX is over
    
    }
}
```

In this section, the instructor provides code snippets for handling the TXE interrupt. The key steps involve sending data through the data register, checking for 16-bit or 8-bit communication, and updating the buffer pointers and lengths accordingly.

## Closing the SPI Transmission

After successfully handling the TXE interrupt, the instructor explains how to close the SPI transmission when the length becomes zero. This involves deactivating the TXEIE bit to prevent further interrupts and resetting the buffer pointers and lengths.

```c
// Check if TxLen is zero, indicating the end of transmission
    if (!pSPIHandle->TxLen)
    {
        // TxLen is zero, so close the SPI transmission and inform the application that TX is over
        
        void SPI_CloseTransmission(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle)
		{
  			 // Deactivate the TXEIE bit in CR2 to disable TXE interrupts
   			 pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 &= ~(1 << SPI_CR2_TXEIE);

    		// Reset the transmit buffer and length
   			 pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer = NULL;
    		 pSPIHandle->TxLen = 0;

   			// Set the transmission state to SPI_READY
              pSPIHandle->TxState = SPI_READY;
          }
        
              __weak void SPI_ApplicationEventCallback(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle, SPI_EVENT_TX_CMPLT)
         {

	              //This is a weak implementation . the user application may override this function.
          }
    
    }
```

Explanation:

- `pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 &= ~(1 << SPI_CR2_TXEIE);`: This line deactivates the TXEIE bit in the CR2 register of the SPI peripheral. This bit is responsible for enabling or disabling the Transmit Buffer Empty (TXE) interrupt. By clearing this bit, the function prevents further TXE interrupts from being triggered, effectively stopping the transmission process.
- `pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer = NULL;`: This line sets the transmit buffer pointer (`pTxBuffer`) in the SPI handle structure to `NULL`, indicating that there is no active transmit buffer.
- `pSPIHandle->TxLen = 0;`: This line sets the transmit length (`TxLen`) in the SPI handle structure to zero. This is done to indicate that there is no more data to be transmitted.
- `pSPIHandle->TxState = SPI_READY;`: This line sets the transmission state (`TxState`) in the SPI handle structure to `SPI_READY`. This state signifies that the SPI peripheral is ready for a new transmission.

The code snippet demonstrates how to deactivate the TXEIE bit, reset buffer pointers and lengths, update the transmission state, and inform the application about the TX completion through the callback function.

## Possible SPI Application Events

The instructor introduces macros defining possible SPI application events, such as TX completion, RX completion, and overruns. These macros are essential for informing the application about specific events during SPI communication.

```c
/*
 * Possible SPI Application events
 */
#define SPI_EVENT_TX_CMPLT   1
#define SPI_EVENT_RX_CMPLT   2
#define SPI_EVENT_OVR_ERR    3
#define SPI_EVENT_CRC_ERR    4
```

These macros are defined in the `stm32f407xx_spi_driver.h` file to make them accessible to the user application.

## Conclusion

The lecture concludes by assigning the exercise to the audience: implementing similar functionality for the RXNE interrupt. This involves creating the corresponding helper function and updating the application callback to handle RX completion events.

In the next lecture, the instructor will likely guide students through the implementation of the RXNE interrupt handling.
