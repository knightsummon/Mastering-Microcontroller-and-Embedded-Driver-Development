# 169. SPI IRQ Handler Implementation (3)



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 lecture! In this session, we've just completed the implementation of the `spi_rxne_interrupt_handle` function. It's essentially the same, intuitive, and easy to implement. In this document, we'll organize and explain the key aspects covered in the lecture.

## SPI Reception Handling

### Loading Data in 16-Bit Format

- If the data format is 16-bit, load data from the Data Register (DR) to the RxBuffer.

### Closing Reception

- Disable the RXNEIE control bit.
- Set RxLen to 0.
- Set the state to ready.
- Call the application callback function with `SPI_EVENT_RX_CMPLT`.

## SPI Overrun Error Handling

- Clear the overrun (ovr) flag.
- Inform the application about the error.

```c
static void  spi_ovr_err_interrupt_handle(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle)
{

	uint8_t temp;
	//1. clear the ovr flag
	if(pSPIHandle->TxState != SPI_BUSY_IN_TX)
	{
		temp = pSPIHandle->pSPIx->DR;
		temp = pSPIHandle->pSPIx->SR;
	}
	(void)temp;
	//2. inform the application
	SPI_ApplicationEventCallback(pSPIHandle,SPI_EVENT_OVR_ERR);

}
```

### Clearing Overrun Flag

- To clear the overrun flag, read the data register followed by a read access to the SPI Status Register (SR).

### Implementation Details

- A dummy variable, `temp`, is used to read the data register.
- The decision to clear the overrun flag is based on the handle state (Tx state not equal to `SPI_BUSY_IN_TX`).
- If the SPI peripheral is busy in Tx, the application needs to clear the overrun flag independently.

## Additional APIs for Application

Two new APIs are introduced for the application to manage communication:

1. `SPI_ClearOVRFlag`: Clears the overrun flag. Application can call this function.
2. `SPI_CloseTransmission` and `SPI_CloseReception`: Abruptly closes SPI transmission or reception. Requires the SPI handle as an argument.

### Closing Transmission and Reception

- Disabling TXEIE and setting buffer address to null for transmission.
- For reception, RXNEIE is disabled, buffer address is initialized to null, and RxState is set to ready.

```c
void SPI_CloseTransmisson(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle)
{
	pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 &= ~( 1 << SPI_CR2_TXEIE);
	pSPIHandle->pTxBuffer = NULL;
	pSPIHandle->TxLen = 0;
	pSPIHandle->TxState = SPI_READY;

}

void SPI_CloseReception(SPI_Handle_t *pSPIHandle)
{
	pSPIHandle->pSPIx->CR2 &= ~( 1 << SPI_CR2_RXNEIE);
	pSPIHandle->pRxBuffer = NULL;
	pSPIHandle->RxLen = 0;
	pSPIHandle->RxState = SPI_READY;

}

//The purpose of this function is to clear the overrun (OVR) flag in the SPI peripheral. An overrun error occurs when new data is received before the previous data has been read. To clear the overrun flag, the function reads the data from both the Data Register (DR) and the Status Register (SR) of the specified SPI peripheral. The actual data is not used; the focus is on acknowledging the reception of data, which helps in clearing the overrun flag.

void SPI_ClearOVRFlag(SPI_RegDef_t *pSPIx)
{
	uint8_t temp;
	temp = pSPIx->DR;
	temp = pSPIx->SR;
	(void)temp;
}
```

## Application Callbacks

- Introduced `ApplicationEventCallback` function to inform the application about SPI events.
- Application must implement this function, and a weak implementation is provided in the driver.c file.
- Macros (`__weak`) are used to handle weak implementations.

## Conclusion

The lecture covered the implementation of SPI reception handling, overrun error handling, and additional APIs for the application. The document provided insights into the decision-making process and implementation details, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the STM32 SPI communication process.
