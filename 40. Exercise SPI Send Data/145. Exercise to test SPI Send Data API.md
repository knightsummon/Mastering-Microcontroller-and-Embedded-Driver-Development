# 145. Exercise to test SPI Send Data API



## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to test the `SPI_SendData` API by sending the string "Hello world" to the external world. This will be achieved by configuring the STM32 microcontroller in master mode using the SPI-2 peripheral. The exercise focuses on transmitting data without involving any SPI slave devices.

## Configuration

Ensure the following configurations are applied for this project:

- **Peripheral:** SPI-2
- **Mode:** Master
- **Serial Clock:** Configure it to the maximum possible speed.
- Data Frame Format (DFF):
  - Test first with DFF = 0.
  - Later, test with DFF = 1.

## Pin Configuration

1. **Master Out Slave In (MOSI):**

   - This pin is required as data is transmitted from the master.
   - Connect the MOSI line for data transmission.

2. **Master In Slave Out (MISO):**

   - Strictly speaking, not required for this exercise.
   - Optional to configure but unnecessary for the project.

3. **Serial Clock (SCK or SCLK):**

   - Necessary for clock synchronization during data transmission.
   - Configure the serial clock pin accordingly.

4. **NSS (Slave Select):**

   - Not required in this case.
   - Since no slaves are involved, there's no need to control NSS.

## Pin Selection

In the upcoming lecture, the focus will be on deciding the pins to be used for communication. For this exercise, only MOSI and serial clock pins are necessary, as MISO and NSS are not essential for the project.
