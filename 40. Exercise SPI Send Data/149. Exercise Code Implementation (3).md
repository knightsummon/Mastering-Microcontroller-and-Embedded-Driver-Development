# 149. Exercise: Code Implementation (3)



## Lecture Overview

Welcome back to the STM32 class! In the previous lecture, we covered the `GPIOInit` and `SPI2_Init` functions. It's essential to understand that after initializing the SPI2 configuration, the peripheral remains inactive. In this lecture, we will focus on enabling the SPI peripheral and creating an API for this purpose.

### Enabling SPI Peripheral

1. **SPI Configuration Setup:**

   - After completing `SPI2_Init`, all necessary configurations are loaded into the control registers of the SPI peripherals.

2. **Peripheral Activation:**

   - The SPI peripheral remains inactive after initialization; it needs to be explicitly enabled.
   - The control bit responsible for enabling is `SPE` (SPI Enable) in the `CR` Control Register.

3. **Control Register Configuration:**

   - All control register configurations should be performed while the SPI peripheral is disabled.
   - The SPI peripheral, by default, is disabled.

4. **API Creation:**

   - A new API, `SPI_PeripheralControl`, is introduced in the driver file (`spi_driver.h`) to enable or disable the SPI peripheral.
   - The API takes a register definition pointer (`rRegDef`) and a second argument indicating whether to enable or disable the peripheral.

   ```c
   SPI_PeripheralControl(SPI2,ENABLE);
   ```

   - Implementation is done in the `stm32f407xx_spi_driver.c` file, utilizing the `CR1` register's `SPE` bit.

   ```c
   /*********************************************************************
    * @fn      		  - SPI_PeripheralControl
    *
    * @brief             -

    * @return            -
    *
    * @Note              -
   
    */
   void SPI_PeripheralControl(SPI_RegDef_t *pSPIx, uint8_t EnOrDi)
   {
   	if(EnOrDi == ENABLE)
   	{
   		pSPIx->CR1 |=  (1 << SPI_CR1_SPE);
   	}else
   	{
   		pSPIx->CR1 &=  ~(1 << SPI_CR1_SPE);
   	}
   
   
   }
   ```

5. **Sample Application:**

   - The newly created API is used in the sample application to enable the SPI2 peripheral.

6. **Code Compilation:**

   - The code is successfully compiled.

## Testing with Logic Analyzer

### Hardware Setup

1. **Connections:**

   - Connect PB13 (serial clock) and PB15 (MOSI) to the logic analyzer's channels.
   - Ground points from the board and logic analyzer should be connected.
   - Connect the logic analyzer to the PC over USB.

2. **USB Port Selection:**

   - Use a high-speed USB 3.0 port on the PC for optimal performance.

3. **Observations:**

   - If using a laptop or computer with a high-speed USB port is recommended.
   - Logic analyzer setup allows monitoring and analyzing SPI communication.

## Next Steps

In the next lecture, we will test the application using logic analyzer software. Ensure that your hardware setup is ready as explained above. If you don't have a logic analyzer, you can observe the process and reproduce it later when you obtain the necessary hardware.
