# 146. Finding out Microcontroller pins to Communication over SPI2



## Importance of Pin Configuration

Before delving into the code, it's essential to understand the significance of configuring GPIO pins for SPI functionality. Failure to properly configure these pins can lead to various issues, such as clock generation problems, data transmission failures between master and slave devices, and other related issues.

## Common Mistakes

Many students encounter difficulties in this area, resulting in complaints about issues like clock generation, data transmission, and more. These problems often stem from improper configuration of GPIO pins for SPI functionality.

## Datasheet Exploration

To configure GPIO pins correctly, refer to the datasheet of your STM32 device. Specifically, focus on the alternate function mapping section. This information is crucial for assigning alternate functions to GPIO pins.

## Identifying SPI2 Pins

1. **Alternate Function Table:**

   - Locate the alternate function table, previously discussed during the GPIO alternate functionality part of the course.
   - Search for SPI2 in the alternate function table.

2. **Pin Identification:**

   - Identify the pins associated with SPI2 functionality.

     - PB9: SPI2_NSS
       - Set alternate functionality mode to 5.
     - PB10: SPI2 Serial Clock
     - PB14: SPI2_MISO
       - Set alternate functionality mode to 5.
     - **PB15: SPI2_MOSI** we choose this pin s MOSI

3. **Additional Pins:**

   - Explore further for additional pins if needed.
     - PC2: MISO
     - PC3: MOSI
     - PI0: SPI2_NSS

## Pin Selection for SPI2 Communication

Choose the appropriate pins based on availability and board constraints. For example:

```c
/*
 * 006spi_tx_testing.c
 *
 *  Created on: Feb 10, 2019
 *      Author: admin
 */

#include<string.h>
#include "stm32f407xx.h"

/*
 * PB14 --> SPI2_MISO
 * PB15 --> SPI2_MOSI
 * PB13 -> SPI2_SCLK
 * PB12 --> SPI2_NSS
 * ALT function mode : 5
 */
```

Reference: https://github.com/niekiran/MasteringMCU/blob/master/Resources/Source_code/Workspace/stm32f4xx_drivers/src/006spi_tx_testing.c

Ensure that the alternate functionality mode for these pins is set to 5.

## Adaptive Solutions

If, for any reason, the selected pins are not available or exposed on the board, consider using SPI1, SPI3, or SPI4 peripherals. Choose the appropriate pins and adjust your code accordingly.
