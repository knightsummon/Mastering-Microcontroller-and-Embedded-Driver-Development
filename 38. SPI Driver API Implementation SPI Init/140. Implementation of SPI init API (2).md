# 140. Implementation of SPI init API (2)



## SPI Initialization

### 1. Clock Configuration

The clock configuration for SPI initialization involves left-shifting a value by 3 positions. This is done as follows:

```c
tempreg |= (value << 3);
```

### 2. DFF (Data Frame Format) Configuration

The Data Frame Format (DFF) configuration requires setting the value to 11. This is achieved as follows:

```c
tempreg |= (11 << DFF_BIT_POSITION);
```

### 3. CPOL and CPHA Configuration

CPOL and CPHA configurations are set based on their respective bit positions in the CR1 register:

- For CPOL (Clock Polarity):

  ```c
  tempreg |= (value << CPOL_BIT_POSITION);
  ```

- For CPHA (Clock Phase):

  ```c
  tempreg |= (value << CPHA_BIT_POSITION);
  ```

### 4. Saving Configuration

Once all configurations are complete, the `tempreg` value is saved into the CR1 register:

```c
SPI_Handle->SPI_CR1 = tempreg;
```

No need to clear bits before setting them, as the `tempreg` is initialized to 0 at the beginning.

## Macro Usage

### 1. Bit Definition Macros

For improved code readability and ease of troubleshooting, it's crucial to replace hardcoded values with macros. These macros should be created in the MCU-specific header file. For example, for the CPHA bit position:

```c
#define SPI_CR1_CPHA_BIT_POSITION 0
```

### 2. Organizing Macros

To maintain a structured approach, organize these macros in a designated section within the MCU-specific header file. For instance:

```c
// In MCU_specific_header.h
// Bit position definitions of SPI peripherals
#define SPI_CR1_CPHA_BIT_POSITION 0
#define SPI_CR1_CPOL_BIT_POSITION 1
#define SPI_CR1_DFF_BIT_POSITION  2
#define SPI_CR1_BR_BIT_POSITION   3
// ... (additional bit position macros)
```

### 3. Implementation in Code

Replace hardcoded values with macros in the code, enhancing readability:

```c
tempreg |= (value << SPI_CR1_CPHA_BIT_POSITION);
```

### 4. Skip Unused Registers

For clarity and efficiency, skip creating macros for registers not in use (e.g., CRC, RX CRC, TX CRC registers). Focus on creating macros for CR1, CR2, and SR.

## Conclusion

By applying these practices, your SPI API implementation will become more organized, readable, and easier to maintain. The use of macros facilitates efficient troubleshooting and allows for straightforward modifications in the future. Take the exercise to create macros for other bit positions and registers, ensuring a well-structured and optimized SPI API.
