## Solution: Add Resistor

`Pull-up resistors` are resistors which are used to ensure that a wire is pulled to a high logical level in the absence of an input signal.

`Pull-down resistors` work in the same manner as pull-up resistors, except that they pull the pin to a logical low value.

GPIO Supports Internal pull-up resistors, which controlled by the GPIO Configure Register, for every GPIO Port.
