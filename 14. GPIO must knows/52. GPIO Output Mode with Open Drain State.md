## Solution: Add Resistor

`Pull-up resistors` are resistors which are used to ensure that a wire is pulled to a high logical level in the absence of an input signal.

`Pull-down resistors` work in the same manner as pull-up resistors, except that they pull the pin to a logical low value.

GPIO Supports Internal pull-up resistors, which controlled by the GPIO Configure Register, for every GPIO Port.

### Why when GPIO in open-drain mode, it can drive multiple device?

When a GPIO pin is configured in open-drain mode, it means that the pin can actively pull the signal low (logic 0), but it cannot actively drive the signal high (logic 1). Instead, it relies on an external pull-up resistor to pull the signal high when the GPIO pin is not actively pulling it low.

In open-drain mode, the GPIO pin effectively acts as a switch that can connect the signal to ground (logic 0) or leave it floating (high impedance), allowing the external pull-up resistor to pull the signal high.

The reason why a GPIO pin in open-drain mode can drive multiple devices is because when the pin is pulled low (logic 0), it effectively connects all the devices to ground. Since each device is connected in parallel to the GPIO pin, they all see the same logic level (logic 0) when the pin is actively pulled low.

This allows multiple devices to share the same GPIO pin in open-drain mode, provided that they are all designed to tolerate being pulled low by the GPIO pin and have their own appropriate pull-up resistors to pull the signal high when the GPIO pin is not actively pulling it low.
