0x4002 3800

## 4. What's the base address of APB1 peripheral register?

In microcontrollers and microprocessors, the term "APB1" typically refers to the Advanced Peripheral Bus 1. It is one of the buses used for connecting peripheral devices to the CPU or core of the microcontroller or microprocessor.

0x4000 0000

## 5. What's the base address of FLASH memory?

The primary use of Flash memory in an MCU is to store the program code that the MCU executes

0x0800 0000

## 6. What's the base address of SRAM2?

In microcontrollers (MCUs), SRAM1 typically refers to the first bank or block of Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM). SRAM is a type of volatile memory that is used for temporary data storage and manipulation within the MCU.

SRAM1 starts from 0x 2000 0000

## 7. What's the base address of ADC registers?

In a microcontroller (MCU), the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) registers are a set of special-purpose registers that control and configure the operation of the MCU's ADC module. The ADC is responsible for converting analog voltage or current signals into digital values that the MCU's digital processing unit can work with.
