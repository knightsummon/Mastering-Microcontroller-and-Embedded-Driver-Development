# 141. Implementation of SPI send data API (1)



## Introduction

Welcome back to the STM32 lecture series! In the previous session, we successfully implemented the `SPI_Init` API. Now, our next task is to work on the `SPI_SendData` API, which is a blocking function responsible for transmitting data over the SPI peripheral.

## API Overview

The `SPI_SendData` API has the following signature:

```c
void SPI_SendData(uint8_t* data, uint16_t length, SPI_TypeDef* SPIx);
```

- `data`: Pointer to the data to be transmitted.
- `length`: Number of bytes to transmit.
- `SPIx`: Base address of the SPI peripheral.

```c
/*********************************************************************
 * @fn      		  - SPI_SendData

 * @Note              - This is blocking call

 */
void SPI_SendData(SPI_RegDef_t *pSPIx,uint8_t *pTxBuffer, uint32_t Len)
{
	
		//1. wait until TXE is set
		

		//2. check the DFF bit in CR1
		
		
			//1. load the data in to the DR
	}

}
```

Let's dive into the flowchart for a detailed understanding of how the `SPI_SendData` API operates.

1. **Check Length**: Upon entering the function, the first step is to check if the length is zero. If so, all bytes have been transmitted, and the function can exit.
2. **Wait for Tx Buffer to be Empty (TXE Flag)**: If the length is not zero, the function waits until the Tx buffer is empty. This is crucial to avoid corrupting existing data in the buffer.
3. **Data Frame Format (DFF) Check**: Once the Tx buffer is empty, the function checks the Data Frame Format (DFF) bit. If DFF is 0, indicating 8-bit data transmission, 1 byte of data is loaded into the Tx buffer. If DFF is 1 (16-bit data), 2 bytes are loaded.
4. **Update Buffer Address and Length**: After loading data into the Tx buffer, the buffer address is incremented, and the length is decremented accordingly.
5. **Repeat until Length is Zero**: Steps 2-4 are repeated until the length becomes zero, ensuring all data is transmitted.
6. **Access to Data Register (DR)**: Note that firmware has no direct access to Tx and Rx buffers. The data register (DR) serves as a window to these buffers. Writing to DR writes to the Tx buffer, and reading from DR returns the value in the Rx buffer.
7. **Handling Rx Buffer (RXNE Flag)**: When receiving data, the RXNE flag in the status register is checked. If set, it indicates the Rx buffer is full, prompting the firmware to read from the Rx buffer.
8. **Animation Explanation**: An animated example illustrates the data flow from the data register to the Tx buffer for transmission and from the Rx buffer to the data register during reception.

Understanding the `SPI_SendData` API's flowchart is crucial for efficient implementation. Remember the importance of checking flags (TXE for transmission, RXNE for reception) and the role of the data register in providing controlled access to internal buffers.
