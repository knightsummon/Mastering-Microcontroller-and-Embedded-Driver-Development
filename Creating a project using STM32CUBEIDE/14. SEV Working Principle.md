# 14. SEV Working Principle



## How are we going to see the message output without a display device connected to our board?

### Using printf outputs on ARM Cortex M3/M4/M7 based MCUs

Printf works over SWO pin(Serial Wire Output) of SWD interface

ARM inside model **ITM** unit

Debug: means read the memory location, processor related register, processor run or halt.  
Trace: get the processor information

## Serial Wire Debug(SWD)

Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a two-wire protocol for accessing the ARM debug interface.

It is part of the ARM Debug Interface Specification V5 and is an alternative to JTAG

The Physical layer of SWD consists of two lines  
SWDIO: a bidirectional data line  
SWCLK: a clock driven by the host  

By using SWD interface should be able to program MCUs internal flash, you can access memory regions, add breakpoints, stop/run CPU.  

The other good thing about SWD is you can use the serial wire viewer for your printf statement for debugging.

SWD interface provides one more pin called **SWO(Serial Wire Output)** which is used for **Single Wire Viewing (SWV)**

Cortex-M based microcontrollers integrate some debugging and tracing technologies, including JTAG and SWD. Tracing allows exporting in real-time internal activities performed by the CPU. The Instrumentation Trace MacroCell (ITM) allows sending software-generated debug messages through a specific signal I/O named **Serial Wire Output (SWO)**.
