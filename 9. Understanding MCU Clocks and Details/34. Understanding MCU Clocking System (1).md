# 34. Understanding MCU Clocking System (1)



## Clocks

Three different clock sources can be used to drive the system clock (SYSCLK):  
• HSI oscillator clock  (High Speed Internal)  
• HSE oscillator clock  (High Speed External)  
• Main PLL (PLL) clock (Phase Locked Loop)   

### The devices have the two following secondary clock sources:

• 32 kHz low-speed internal RC (LSI RC) which drives the independent watchdog and,
optionally, the RTC used for Auto-wakeup from the Stop/Standby mode.  
• 32.768 kHz low-speed external crystal (LSE crystal) which optionally drives the RTC
clock (RTCCLK)

Crystal Oscillator: always connect the externals to the MCU  
RC Oscillator: Implemented inside the MCU  
PLL: internal, you can use one among these in order to drive the Clocks for the MCU. PLLs come in various configurations, including `Analog` and `Digital` implementations
