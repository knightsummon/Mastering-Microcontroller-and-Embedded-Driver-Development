# 44. Understanding MCU Interrupt Design, NVIC, Interrupt Handling: (2)



## Design of the ST

Some Peripherals deliver their interrupt to the NVIC over the EXTI line.

Some Peripherals deliver their interrupt directly to the NVIC.

## GPIO External Inputs Interrupts

My user reset button is connected to PA0, If I push the user button, then my interrupt will come over EXTI0 line.
