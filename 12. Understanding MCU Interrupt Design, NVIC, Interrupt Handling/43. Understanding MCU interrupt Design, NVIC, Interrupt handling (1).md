**Goal: When I push this button, I should get an interrupt in my application.**

## How the GPIO pin interrupts the processor?

23: 23 External Interrupts.

```
12.2 External interrupt/event controller (EXTI)
The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 23 edge detectors for generating event/interrupt requests. Each input line can be independently configured to select the type (interrupt or event) and the corresponding trigger event (rising or falling or both). Each line can also masked independently. A pending register maintains the status line of the interrupt requests.
```

EXTI Controller has 23 lines which is going to the NVIC.

What on the table, there is no name with "GPIO". How "GPIO" interacts system to perform interrupts?
